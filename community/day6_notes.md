Cool series! It's always interesting for me to learn by watching how other
people work. The iterate function was new to me and the :strs destructuring.
Also the little trick of using ->> threading within -> threading is neat. Thanks
for sharing!

Rule of thumb: you can always nest inside a thread-first
